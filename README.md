<h1>Book Content Publishing System</h1>

Time restricted examination - 2 hrs 30 mins

The specifcation required the creation of a Book Content Publishing System application that would support several specific 'Book Types' including 'AudioBook' (which I would be responsible for), 'PrintBook', 'EBook', and 'WebComic'.

Each 'Book Type' would have shared instance variables and methods with all content as well as specific instance variables and methods for their own type.

This OOP solution required the use of inheritance, ENUMs as well as full JUnit testing.

A driver class Bookshelf would also be required to facilite user searches - using parameterised methods.
